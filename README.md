# Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Machine Learning Models

## Description:
This repository explores various datasets for machine learning tasks, including:
* Zomato restaurant reviews
* Flight price prediction
* Diabetes diagnosis
* Alcohol quality detection
Basic EDA and data visualizations are provided for each dataset to gain insights and prepare them for further modeling.

## Project Structure:

* data: Contains the raw datasets for each domain (Zomato, flight_data, diabetes, etc.)
* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code for EDA and visualizations (one notebook per dataset is recommended for clarity)
* figures: Output visualizations generated during the EDA
